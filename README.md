# Get details for a Greek VAT code
This repository aims to host diverse client programs
that obtain the details associated with a Greek VAT number,
through the
[web service](http://gsis.gr/gsis/info/gsis_site/PublicIssue/wnsp/wnsp_pages/wnsp.html)
provided by the Greek Public Revenue Authority and
the General Secretariat of Information Systems at the Greek Ministry of Finance.

Details about each client are provided in the `README` file in each directory.
Currently the following client is provided.

* Bash: Unix (and Cygwin) _bash_ shell script
